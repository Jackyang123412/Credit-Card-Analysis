# Problem Definition:
Our goal is to explore trends, clusters and relationship between different factors affecting applicants who apply for a loan and compare that to the credit payment behaviour of applicants who were approved for a loan. We will be using SQL and visualizations on a credit card applications dataset. The dataset includes two tables; one for applicants who apply for a loan and other for credit payment behavior of applicants who have a loan.

The goal of this project is to explore the relationships between various factors and affecting applicants w

# Introduction and Motivation
Credit card payment defaults are a huge cause of concern for the banking industry and the outstanding balances have only been increasing with time over the past years. Research has shown that Americans’ total credit card balance is 
46 billion jump from $841 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Despite the high levels of debt and repayment defaults that the companies face, they must extend their services to more people to gain profits. Our primary goal with this project is to analyze the data of the applicants that have applied for a credit card and understand the factors that contribute to the acceptance of credit card applicants. We will also be using a complimentary dataset consisting of users that did receive the credit card in order to understand the difference in the analysis between the applicants and the card holders. We will be using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle that holds credit card applicants’ data as well as the credit card holders’ data.
